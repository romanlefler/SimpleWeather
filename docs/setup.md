# Set Up for Development

Note that working on this project requires the GNOME shell,
the GNU gettext utilities, and npm.

If you are just translating you can use any text editor or
a specialized translation editor.

If you want to write code then preferably use an editor that supports
TypeScript/LSPs like VS Code, Neovim, or Emacs.
